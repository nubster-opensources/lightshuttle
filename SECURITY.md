# Security policy

## Supported versions

LightShuttle follows the [semver policy](docs/SEMVER_POLICY.md). During the 0.x phase, only the latest minor release receives security fixes.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

The supported window will be widened once LightShuttle reaches 1.0.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in LightShuttle, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue. Disclosure rules:

1. Email a detailed report to **security@encelade.tech** with the subject prefix `[lightshuttle security]`.
2. The report should include:
   - A description of the vulnerability and the attacker model.
   - Affected versions and crates.
   - Reproduction steps or a proof of concept.
   - The impact you anticipate (data leak, denial of service, privilege escalation, etc.).
   - Suggested mitigation if you have one.
3. You will receive an acknowledgement within **7 calendar days**. If you do not, please follow up at the same address.
4. We will work with you to validate, scope and remediate the issue. A coordinated disclosure timeline will be agreed in writing. The default embargo period is **90 days** from acknowledgement.
5. Once a fix is published, you will be credited in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Encrypted reporting

If your report includes confidential proof-of-concept material, please encrypt it with the Encelade Technologies security GPG key. The fingerprint and public key are published at <https://encelade.tech/.well-known/security.txt> (once Encelade Technologies publishes them).

## Out of scope

The following are explicitly **out of scope** for vulnerability reports:

- Issues in unsupported versions.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that are already publicly disclosed and tracked upstream. Report them to the upstream project.
- Reports based on theoretical attacks without a working proof of concept.
- Attacks that require a malicious or compromised Docker daemon, or a malicious operator with local control of the host. The threat model assumes a trusted local Docker daemon, used by a developer on their own workstation; LightShuttle is a local development orchestrator and is not a production-hardened sandbox.
- Resource exhaustion caused by manifests authored by the developer themselves (LightShuttle runs what you ask it to run).

## Public security advisories

Confirmed and fixed vulnerabilities are published on the GitHub Security Advisories page of the repository. RustSec advisories are also coordinated for severe issues when applicable.
